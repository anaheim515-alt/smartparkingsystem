The Smart Car Parking System is a web-based application designed to efficiently manage parking slot availability and vehicle transactions. It allows users to park and leave vehicles by recording plate numbers and automatically assigning available slots in real time. The system continuously updates parking status to ensure accurate monitoring of occupied and available spaces. An admin module securely tracks transactions and generates sales data for management and reporting purposes.
